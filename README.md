# swivel-joint
Precision 3D joint assembly designed using Onshape software.

# Overview

A rotary joint is a core mechanical component that allows two connected parts to rotate around a common axis. It is widely used in various mechanical systems and applications, including:
 • Robotic arms
 • Mechanical linkages
 • Automation systems
 • Educational engineering projects

# To view, edit, or export the rotary joint design, follow these steps:

1. Create an Onshape Account
Go to onshape.com (https://www.onshape.com/) and sign up for a free account.
 2. Start a New Document
Open Onshape and create a new document to begin your design process.
 3. Design the Rotary Joint
Use Onshape’s tools such as:
 • Sketch to outline the shape
 • Extrude to add depth
 • Fillet to smooth edges and corners
 4. Export the Model
Once your design is complete, export the file as:
 • .SLDPRT for use in CAD software
 • .STL for 3D printing or viewing

# Why This Design is Useful
 • Easy to modify for specific mechanical needs
 • Suitable for students, engineers, and hobbyists
 • Compatible with most 3D printers
 • Built with real-world mechanical design principles
